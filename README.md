# ssd-hdd
windows tool that mirror a ssd folder on hdd

This soft moves a folder from a SSD to a HDD, freeing some precious space.
The original folder is moved, but a link replaces it, so that all your stuff is still accessible from the SSD, while the paths are still OK.

ssd-hdd works with NTFS junctions. This means that the mirroring is quite transparent, but some rare application may have some issue with those junctions.

#I wrote this soft for me, use it at your own risk.
While I don't try to kill your data, a bug is always possible, so if you are sure you want to use it, please, PLEASE make a backup of moved folder beforehand.

#todo
a revert option
